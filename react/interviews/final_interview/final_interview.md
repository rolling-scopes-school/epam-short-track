## Possible practical tasks

- Write a functional and a class-based component.
- Write a component that accepts specific props and embed them in JSX.
- Add a controlled component (e.g., form input).
- Use useEffect to log a value to the console whenever it changes.
- Decompose a component into smaller components.
- Connect a ref to a form and log the form value to the console.
- Create a context with a default value, wrap child components with a provider, pass new values, and subscribe to context changes in a child component.
- Write a test for a React component.
