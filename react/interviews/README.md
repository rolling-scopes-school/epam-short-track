# Technical interview

The goal of the technical interview is to prepare to the real React project interview.

## Interview:

1. The Cross interview is mandatory, the final (mentor interview) is not mandatory and is not required for a certificate
2. Cross interviews are conducted at the end of each week, final interview must be carried out after completion of all modules.
3. To be eligible to participate in the interview, the student must complete and receive credit for all mandatory homework assignments, complete Cross interviews.

## Interview structure

The technical interview should be comprised of:

1. Introduction
   This part assumes acquaintance. You should introduce yourself, briefly tell about your experience and ask the student to introduce himself and describe his experience (you could also ask about his motivation in chosing the Front-end stack).
   You should also describe the interview structure and ask the student whether he/she has any questions.
   **This part should mitigate the tension and make the interview more productive.**
2. Theory  
   You can and should ask questions and listen to the answers. Please, do not interrupt the student or provide answers instead of him. It's worth making notes to discuss some specific answers later during the feedback. Student should be speaking approximately 80% of this part's time (the rest 20% should be an interviewer speaking).
3. Practical task
   Small task in React. Please, pay attention to the code, knowledge of the basic React patterns and ability to solve the task.
   You can use online editors for mutual work for this task (e.g. [ReplIT](https://replit.com/))
4. Feedback
   You can base it on the notes you were taking during the 2nd step. The goal is to give an objective estimate. You should denote the good parts first (even if it was little), and then switch to the issues. Please, share the theoretical materials which can address the issue.
5. Final part
   **Important part**
   You should ask the student whether he/she has any questions. You should also thank the student for his/her time and wish him/her all the best in his/her endeavors.
