1. What are the main lifecycle stages of a React component, and how do they differ between class and functional components?
2. How does the `useEffect` hook work in functional components? Can you give an example of its usage?
3. What are error boundaries in React, and when would you use them?
4. What causes a React component to re-render, and what strategies can be used to optimize re-renders?
5. What is the Context API in React, and when should it be used over prop drilling?
6. What are the key methods provided by Context API (e.g., `createContext` and `useContext`), and how are they used?
7. What is the purpose of `Context.Provider` and `Context.Consumer`, and how do they work together in the Context API?
8. Why is client-side routing important in single-page applications?
9. How do you set up a basic React Router configuration? What types of routers (e.g., `BrowserRouter`, `HashRouter`) are typically used?
10. What are nested routes, and how can they be implemented using React Router?
11. How would you implement authenticated/protected routes in a React app with React Router?

13. How are render props used to share state or functionality between components?
14. What are custom hooks in React, and how do they enhance code reusability and abstraction?
15. When would you use hooks, higher-order components (HOCs), or render props? How do these patterns compare in terms of reusability and clarity?
