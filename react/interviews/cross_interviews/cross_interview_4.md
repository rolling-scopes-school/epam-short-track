# Cross Interview #4

The goal of the technical interview is to check the quality of learning on topics: Context API, Redux fundamentals, React-Redux integration, Redux Toolkit, Async Redux operations.

## Interview questions list

### Context API
  1. What is the Context API in React, and what problem does it solve?

  5. What is the purpose of `Context.Provider` and `Context.Consumer`, and how do they work together in the Context API?
  6. How can you update context values and trigger re-renders?
  7. What are the performance considerations when using Context API?
