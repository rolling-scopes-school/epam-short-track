# Cross Interview #4

The goal of the technical interview is to check the quality of learning on topics: Context API, Redux fundamentals, React-Redux integration, Redux Toolkit, Async Redux operations.

## Interview questions list

### Context API
  1. What is the Context API in React, what problem does it solve, and how do you create and provide a context in a React application?
  2. What are the key methods (hooks) provided by Context API (e.g., `createContext` and `useContext`), and how are they used?
  3. What is the purpose of `Context.Provider` and `Context.Consumer`, and how do they work together in the Context API?
  4. How do you consume context values in functional and class components, and how can you update those context values to trigger re-renders?
  5. What are the performance considerations when using Context API?
  6. When should you use Context API over prop drilling or Redux for state management?

### Redux Fundamentals
  1. What is Redux, what is it used for, and what are its core principles?
  2. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of using Redux?
  3. What is a Redux store, what APIs does it provide, and how can it be created?
  4. What are actions in Redux, and what role do they play?
  5. What is a reducer in Redux, and what role does it play?
  6. How do actions and reducers interact in Redux?
  7. How does Redux ensure state immutability?
  8. What are selectors in Redux, and why are they needed?
  9. What is data normalization in Redux, and why is it important?
  10. How do you structure a large Redux application for scalability?

### React-Redux
  1. What does the react-redux library do, and why is it necessary?
  2. How do you provide the Redux store to a React application?
  3. What is `connect`, and how does it differ from `useSelector` and `useDispatch`?
  4. How do you connect a React component to the Redux store using `connect`?
  5. How do you optimize React components to prevent unnecessary re-renders when using Redux?
  6. What is reselect, and how is it useful when working with Redux selectors?

### Redux Toolkit
  1. What is Redux Toolkit, and why was it introduced?
  2. What are the advantages of using Redux Toolkit compared to classic Redux?
  3. How does Redux Toolkit simplify reducer and action creation?
  4. What is the purpose of `createAsyncThunk` in Redux Toolkit?

### Async Redux
  1. What is middleware in Redux, and how does it work?
  2. What is Redux Thunk, how does it work and what does it allow you to do?
  3. How do you handle asynchronous actions in Redux?
  4. How do you manage loading and error states in async Redux flows?
