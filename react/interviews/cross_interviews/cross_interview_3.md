# Cross Interview #3

The goal of the technical interview is to check the quality of learning on topics: React Router, Advanced patterns (HOCs, Render Props, Custom Hooks, Compound Components), React Testing.

## Interview questions list

### React Router
  1. What is React Router and how does it enhance single-page applications?
  2. How do you set up basic routing in a React app? What types of routers (e.g., `BrowserRouter`, `HashRouter`) are typically used?
  3. What is the difference between `BrowserRouter` and `HashRouter`?
  4. How do you implement nested routes in React Router?
  5. How can you programmatically navigate between routes?
  6. How do you handle dynamic route parameters?
  7. How would you implement authenticated/protected routes in a React app with React Router?
  8. How do you display a 404 page for unmatched routes?
  9. What types of routers do you know?
  10. What approaches can you use to configure router for your application?
  11. What is the purpose of the Link and NavLink components, and how do they differ?
  12. How do you handle scroll restoration or scroll position when navigating between routes?

### Advanced Patterns
  13. What are higher-order components (HOCs), and why are they useful? Can you provide an example?
  14. How are render props used to share state or functionality between components?
  15. What is the function-as-children pattern and when is it useful?
  16. How do you implement the compound component pattern?
  17. What are custom hooks in React, and how do they enhance code reusability and abstraction?
  18. When would you use hooks, higher-order components (HOCs), or render props? What are the trade-offs between these patterns?

### React Testing
  19. What are the key principles of testing in React?
  20. What are the differences between unit, integration, and end-to-end testing in React?
  21. How do you set up Jest and React Testing Library?
  22. How do you test a component that uses hooks?
  23. How do you mock API calls and create mocks in tests for React components?
  24. How do you test user interactions like clicks and form submissions?
  25. What is snapshot testing and when should it be used?
  26. How do you test asynchronous behavior in React components?
  27. How do you avoid testing implementation details?
  28. What are best practices for writing maintainable React tests?
  29. What is the difference between getBy, queryBy and findBy queries?
  30. How do you test components that use third-party libraries or APIs?
