# General requirements for all the tasks

Those requirements are applied to all the tasks, if not provided in the task explicitly

## Repository requirements

- The task should be completed in **private school repository**.
- In the repository, create a branch from the `main` branch using the name suggested in the task and work within this newly created branch.
- The commit history should reflect the process of creating the app. Refer to [Commit requirements](https://rs.school/docs/en/git-convention) for details.
- Once development is complete, you need to create a Pull Request from the current task branch to the previous task branch, or `main` if the previous task branch doesn't exist or the task is not inherited from the previous one. Refer to [Pull Request requirements](https://rs.school/docs/en/pull-request-review-process#pull-request-requirements-pr) for details.
- Task should be deployed using *gh-pages*, *netlify* or other hoisting.

**Do not merge Pull Request from the development branch to the `main` branch**

## Cross-check process

Open the provided link to the deployed app and check that the functionality is working (cross-check). You can check details [here](https://rs.school/docs/en/cross-check-flow)
