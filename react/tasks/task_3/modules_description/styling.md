# Styling Guidelines

## Overview
To add a creative touch to this task, the component styling is entirely up to you. While we have provided some initial styles in the `styles.module.scss` files for the components, you are free to use, modify, or remove them as you see fit.

## Requirements
The only requirement is to ensure that all page elements are positioned according to the provided design specifications in Figma.
