# React Security 🌟

## Module Overview 📚

This module focuses on security best practices in React applications. It aims to provide students with an understanding of common security vulnerabilities, particularly Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, and how to prevent them. The module covers the risks associated with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, best practices for handling user input, third-party library security considerations, and secure coding practices for React applications.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

Students will:

- Understand common security risks in React applications, particularly XSS vulnerabilities.
- Learn about the risks associated with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` and when it can be safely used.
- Explore best practices for preventing XSS attacks in React.
- Understand security considerations when using third-party React libraries.
- Learn about React Server Components security vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them.
- Apply secure coding practices in React applications.
