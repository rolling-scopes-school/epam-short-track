# React Compiler 🌟

## Module Overview 📚

This module introduces students to the React Compiler, a build-time optimization tool introduced in React 19. It aims to provide an understanding of how the React Compiler automatically optimizes React components, eliminating the need for manual memoization with hooks like `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `React.memo`. The module covers installation, configuration, and the benefits of using the compiler in React applications.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

Students will:

- Understand what the React Compiler is and what problems it solves.
- Learn how to install and configure the React Compiler using Babel plugin.
- Explore how the compiler automatically optimizes React components.
- Understand the benefits of using React Compiler over manual memoization techniques.
- Get familiar with React Compiler configuration options and directives.
