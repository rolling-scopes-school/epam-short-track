# [React](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/tree/master/react) Next.js. SSR and SSG ⚙️

## Module Overview 📚

This module introduces students to Server Side Rendering and Static Site Generation with Next.js framework. It aims to provide an in-depth understanding of server rendering and difference between client and server computations. The module covers a range of topics from understating the principles of server rendering to implementing it with Next.js, and React Server Components.

In addition, this module covers alternative approaches of enabling SSG and SSR for React application: the React-Router 7 (ex Remix), and TanStack Start.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

Students will:

- Understand principles and goals of server rendering.
- Learn how to migrate from client to server rendering with Next.js.
- Get familiar with React Server Components.
