# React DOM 🌟

## Module Overview 📚

This module covers React DOM interactions, focusing on useRef, createRef, ref forwarding, and Synthetic events. It provides a deep dive into managing DOM references and handling events in a React way.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

Students will:

- Understand how to use useRef and createRef to access DOM elements.
- Learn about ref forwarding and its use cases.
- Explore Synthetic events and how React abstracts native browser events.
- Apply knowledge to manage focus, media playback, and animations directly.
