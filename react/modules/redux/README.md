# Redux and React-Redux 🌟

## Module Overview 📚

This module explores the use of Redux and React-Redux in managing state in large-scale React applications. It covers the core principles of Redux, its comparison with Context API, and the use of React-Redux hooks like `useDispatch` and `useSelector`.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

Students will:

- Understand the core principles of Redux and how it manages state.
- Learn about the use cases for Redux and when to choose Redux over Context.
- Explore the React-Redux library, particularly the use of `Provider`, `useDispatch`, and `useSelector`.
- Differentiate between presentational and container components in a Redux architecture.
