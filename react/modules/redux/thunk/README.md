# Redux Thunk 🌟

## Module Overview 📚

This module covers Redux Thunk, a middleware that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. It is essential for handling asynchronous actions in a Redux application.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

Students will:

- Understand what Redux Thunk is and why it is useful.
- Learn how to integrate Redux Thunk into a Redux store.
- Explore how to handle asynchronous operations within Redux actions.
- Apply Redux Thunk in practical scenarios to manage complex state behaviors.
