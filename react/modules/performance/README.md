# Performance Optimization in React 🌟

## Module Overview 📚

This module focuses on optimizing the performance of React applications. It covers memoization, React.memo, useMemo, useCallback, keys, React Profiler, React.lazy, and Suspense.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

Students will:

- Understand the importance of performance optimization in React.
- Learn how to use memoization techniques like useMemo and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Explore the use of React.memo to optimize functional components.
- Utilize keys effectively in list rendering.
- Implement code splitting using React.lazy and Suspense.
