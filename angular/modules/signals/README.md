## Theory

- Benefits of using signals
  - `Asynchronicity`: Signals allow for efficient handling of asynchronous operations, such as user event processing or asynchronous server requests.
  - `Data management`: They provide a convenient way to manage data and its flow within an application.
  - `Change tracking`: Signals offer a mechanism to track data changes and respond to them in real time.
  - `Multiple subscriptions`: A single signal can have multiple subscribers, ensuring flexibility in information transmission between different parts of an application.
  - `Data manipulation`: Signals enable various operations with data, such as filtering, transforming, merging, and much more.
