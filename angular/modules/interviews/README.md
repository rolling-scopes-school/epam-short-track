# Rules for Conducting Cross-Interviews

The purpose of cross-interviews is to provide students with the opportunity to prepare for real front-end developer interviews, particularly with Angular. Students take turns conducting interviews with each other, playing the roles of interviewer and candidate.

## Cross-Interview Procedure:

### General Rules

1. **Format**: Interviews are conducted in pairs, where one student acts as the interviewer and the other as the candidate.
2. **Time**: Each interview should last no more than one hour.

### Interview Structure

1. **Theory**
   - The interviewer asks questions about the theoretical aspects of Angular and front-end development.
   - The candidate responds to the questions, trying to stay within the time limits.
   - The interviewer takes notes for subsequent feedback.

2. **Feedback**
   - The interviewer provides the candidate with objective feedback.
   - Start with the positive aspects, then move to areas that need improvement.
   - At the end of the interview, review all errors and contentious points using documentation and theoretical materials to help the candidate improve their knowledge.
   - If contentious issues arise during the interview, they should be raised with the course coordinators to receive an objective assessment and resolve the matter.

# Evaluation

Each student will receive up to 10 points for participating in the cross-interview.
