# Core JS mentors interview #2

#### TypeScript
1. What is the difference between TypeScript and JavaScript, and why would you choose TypeScript for a project?
2. Explain what structural typing is in TypeScript and how it differs from nominal typing.
3. What are the primitive types in TypeScript, and how are they different from JavaScript's types?
4. How do `Partial<T>` and `Required<T>` utility types differ, and why would you use them in your code?
5. What is the difference between `never` and `void` in TypeScript, and when would you use each?
6. What are generics in TypeScript, and how can they make functions or classes more reusable? Provide examples.
7. How does the `Pick<T, K>` utility type differ from `Omit<T, K>`, and when would you use each of them?
8. Describe the difference between `any` and `unknown` in TypeScript and discuss scenarios where one should be preferred over the other.
9. How does the use of `interface` differ from `type` in TypeScript, and when would you choose one over the other?
10. What is the purpose of the `readonly` modifier in TypeScript, and how does it differ from a const variable?

#### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
11. What is the difference between `public`, `private`, `protected` and `static` members in a TypeScript/JavaScript class, and what are their use cases?
12. Discuss SOLID principles and how they apply to Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript or TypeScript.
13. What is the `instanceof` operator in JavaScript, and how does it work when checking if an object belongs to a specific class?
14. How do ES2015 classes simplify creating objects compared to traditional functions and prototypal inheritance in JavaScript?
15. Explain how you can achieve multiple inheritance in TypeScript and how it differs from extending classes in traditional OOP.

#### Async JavaScript
16. What is the difference between `setTimeout` and `setInterval` in JavaScript, and how can you stop them from running?
17. What are `Promise.all()` and `Promise.race()`, and how do they differ in their behavior when resolving multiple promises? 
18. How does `async/await` syntax enhances the readability and maintainability of asynchronous JavaScript code compared to traditional promise chains?
19. What is the role of the `finally` block in error handling, and how does it interact with `try` and `catch` blocks in JavaScript?
20. How can you create and `throw` a custom error in JavaScript, and why would you do so? Provide a practical example.
